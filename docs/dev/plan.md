# Implementation Plan: Bayesian Network Generator Service

## Phase 1: Core Network Structure
### Epic: Basic Types
- [ ] Implement Node interface
  - Must have minimum 2 states
  - States represent observable conditions
  - CPT represents relationship model
- [ ] Implement Edge interface
  - Represents causal relationships
  - Direction indicates influence flow
- [ ] Create CPT structure
  - Start with discrete state mappings
  - Design for extensibility (functions, sampling)
  - Support complex relationship modeling
- [ ] Build Network container
  - Keep core structure minimal
  - Focus on relationship representation
  - Validate structural integrity

### Epic: Network Operations
- [ ] Basic Operations
  - Add/remove nodes and edges
  - Query network structure
  - Validate network integrity (DAG)
- [ ] CPT Operations
  - Calculate conditional probabilities
  - Handle missing or uncertain data
  - Support different CPT implementations
- [ ] Network Analysis
  - Find influence paths
  - Identify constant patterns
  - Detect structural constraints

## Phase 2: Evolution System
### Epic: Evidence Collection
- [ ] Design evidence structure
  - Capture real-world observations
