# Network Evolution System Design

## Context
Our Bayesian Network needs to adapt to real-world data streams where:
1. Initial probabilities may be based on conjecture
2. Evidence quality varies over time
3. Anomalous patterns may indicate unmodeled causal factors
4. Network structure itself may need to evolve

## Decision
Implement a Network Evolution System with three core components:

### 1. Evidence Quality Tracking
```typescript
interface EvidenceMetrics {
    sampleSize: number;        // Number of observations
    timeWindow: {              // When observations occurred
        start: Date;
        end: Date;
    };
    confidence: number;        // Statistical confidence (0-1)
    source: 'empirical' | 'conjecture' | 'derived';
}

interface Node {
    // ... existing fields ...
    evidence: EvidenceMetrics;
    observations: Array<{
        timestamp: Date;
        value: string;
        weight: number;
    }>;
}
```

### 2. Anomaly Detection
```typescript
interface AnomalyDetector {
    windowSize: number;        // How many recent observations to consider
    thresholds: {
        variance: number;      // Statistical variance threshold
        sequence: number;      // Consecutive unexpected values
        confidence: number;    // Confidence level for anomaly
    };
    detectAnomalies(observations: Array<Observation>): AnomalyReport;
}
```

### 3. Network Variants
```typescript
interface NetworkVariant {
    parentNetwork: Network;
    divergencePoint: {
        timestamp: Date;
        anomaly: AnomalyReport;
    };
    hypothesizedFactors: Array<{
        name: string;
        confidence: number;
        evidence: EvidenceMetrics;
    }>;
    validateHypothesis(): ValidationResult;
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Network can adapt to changing conditions
2. Clear tracking of evidence quality
3. Systematic approach to discovering new causal factors
4. Maintains historical context through network lineage

### Negative
1. Increased complexity in probability calculations
2. Need for careful threshold tuning
3. Risk of spurious variant creation
4. Higher storage requirements

## Implementation Strategy

1. Phase 1: Evidence Quality
   - Add evidence metrics to nodes
   - Implement time-based weighting
   - Track observation history

2. Phase 2: Anomaly Detection
   - Create sliding window observer
   - Implement statistical tests
   - Define anomaly thresholds

3. Phase 3: Network Variants
   - Implement network copying
   - Add divergence tracking
   - Create hypothesis testing

4. Phase 4: Network Evolution
   - Implement variant validation
   - Add network merging
   - Create lineage tracking

## Validation Criteria

1. Evidence Quality
   - Confidence metrics reflect sample size
   - Time decay properly weights old vs new evidence
   - Source classification affects probability updates

2. Anomaly Detection
   - Correctly identifies statistical anomalies
   - Minimizes false positives
   - Provides clear anomaly reports

3. Network Variants
   - Successfully spawns variant networks
   - Tracks hypotheses effectively
   - Validates or invalidates variants based on evidence

## Open Questions

1. How do we determine optimal window sizes for anomaly detection?
2. What statistical tests are most appropriate for our use case?
3. How do we prevent explosion of variant networks?
4. When should variants be merged back into parent networks?
