# Project Post-Mortem & Decision Log

## 2024-01-21: Initial Project Setup
### Context
Project initialized to explore the combination of LLMs and Bayesian Networks for real-world system modeling and monitoring.

### Key Decisions
1. **REST Service Architecture**
   - Chosen for flexibility and wide integration potential
   - Allows for future scaling and distributed deployment
   - Enables easy integration with existing systems

2. **Technology Stack Decisions**
   - Node.js with Express for REST service (excellent performance, wide adoption)
   - TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability
   - Need to evaluate JavaScript/TypeScript Bayesian Network libraries

### Open Questions
1. How to optimize LLM prompting for consistent network generation?
2. Best approach for real-time probability updates in large networks?
3. Efficient storage strategy for historical network states?

### Next Steps
1. Begin with core Bayesian Network implementation in TypeScript
2. Develop proof-of-concept for LLM network generation
3. Create basic data ingestion pipeline

## 2024-01-21: Technology Stack Change

### Impact
- Switched from FastAPI to Node.js/Express
- Will use TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability
- Need to research TypeScript-compatible Bayesian Network libraries

### Benefits
- Large ecosystem of JavaScript libraries
- Excellent async/streaming support
- Strong typing with TypeScript
- Great tooling and IDE support
- Large developer community

## 2024-01-21: Fundamental Insight - Neural-Symbolic Bridge
### Context
Discovered a fundamental principle about the role of Bayesian Networks in agent collaboration.

### Key Insight
The system serves three distinct but interconnected roles:

1. **Neural Layer (Intuitive Response)**
   - LLM's trained patterns provide immediate, intuitive responses
   - Similar to human expert intuition
   - Based on deep neural patterns, not explicit reasoning
   - The actual decision-making happens here

2. **Symbolic Layer (Communication)**
   - Bayesian Network provides formal structure
   - Probability tables capture intuitive knowledge
   - Post-hoc rationalization of neural responses
   - Enables explicit communication of implicit knowledge

3. **Interface Layer (Collaboration)**
   - Shared mental model between agents
   - Common framework for discussing predictions
   - Bridge between different neural implementations
   - Enables synchronization of understanding

### Implications
1. **Truth vs. Communication**
   - The Bayesian Network isn't the "truth" of how decisions are made
   - It's a communication tool for sharing intuitive understanding
   - Enables agents to align their neural patterns through symbolic discussion

2. **Learning Process**
   - Deviations between predicted and actual outcomes aren't "errors"
   - They're opportunities for agents to refine their shared mental model
   - The communication layer adapts to better reflect neural patterns

3. **System Design**
   - Focus on translation between intuitive and explicit knowledge
   - Prioritize explainability over pure accuracy
   - Build tools for model alignment between agents

### Next Steps
1. Design prompting system to extract intuitive knowledge
2. Create framework for translating between neural and symbolic representations
3. Develop tools for tracking and discussing model alignment

### Impact on Architecture
- Separate intuitive response generation from explanation generation
- Build explicit translation layers between representations
- Focus on tools for model comparison and alignment
- Prioritize narrative generation for model differences

## 2024-01-21: Critical Insight - Real-World Coupling
### Context
Realized fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of intuition and confidence in neural systems.

### Key Insight
True intuition emerges from real-world coupling:

1. **Prediction-Experience Loop**
   - Real intuition requires continuous prediction-verification cycles
   - System must make predictions and see outcomes
   - Confidence emerges from prediction accuracy
   - Without this coupling, no true intuition exists

2. **Training vs. Guessing**
   - LLM's initial responses are educated guesses from text patterns
   - Not true intuitions born from experience
   - Can't have real confidence without prediction history
   - Need continuous coupling to develop actual intuition

3. **Emergence of Competence**
   - Competence = reduced surprise at stream elements
   - Confidence = high prediction accuracy over time
   - Both require actual experience with data streams
   - Can't be synthesized from static training

### Implications for Design
1. **Initial Phase**
   - LLM provides initial probability structure
   - These are educated guesses, not intuitions
   - Must be clearly marked as untrained predictions
   - No claim of confidence possible

2. **Learning Phase**
   - System must track prediction accuracy
   - Build confidence metrics from actual performance
   - Gradually develop true intuition
   - Allow probability adjustments based on experience

3. **Maturity Indicators**
   - Measure reduction in prediction surprise
   - Track confidence through accuracy history
   - Monitor emergence of stable patterns
   - Identify areas of developed competence

### Architecture Impact
- Need continuous feedback loops
- Must track prediction history
- Require confidence metrics
- Essential to mark prediction maturity level

### Revised Approach
1. Start with LLM's educated guesses
2. Implement real-world coupling immediately
3. Build prediction tracking system
4. Develop confidence metrics
5. Allow model evolution based on experience

This fundamentally changes our understanding of the system's learning process and the role of real-world data coupling.
