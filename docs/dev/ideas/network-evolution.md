# Network Evolution Concept

## Overview
Extend the Bayesian Network to become an adaptive system that can:
- Track evidence quality and confidence
- Detect anomalous patterns
- Spawn variant networks to explore new causal hypotheses

## Key Components

### Evidence Quality Tracking
- Sample size tracking
- Time-based evidence weighting
- Source classification (empirical vs conjectural)
- Confidence metrics

### Anomaly Detection
- Sliding window observation
- Statistical variance testing
- Pattern recognition
- Threshold management

### Network Variants
- Network branching on anomaly detection
- Hypothesis tracking
- Variant validation
- Network lineage management

## Dependencies
- Requires robust base Bayesian Network implementation
- Needs solid probability calculation system
- Must have reliable evidence handling
- Requires comprehensive testing framework

## Questions to Address
1. How to determine optimal window sizes for anomaly detection?
2. What statistical tests are most appropriate?
3. How to prevent explosion of variant networks?
4. When should variants be merged back into parent networks?

## Future Consideration
This is a significant enhancement to be considered after the core Bayesian Network functionality is solid and well-tested.
